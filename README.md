# react-router-tutorial

React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router runs anywhere React runs; on the web, on the server with node.js, and on React Native.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know the APIs you deal with day-to-day with React Router. After that, you can dig into some of the other docs to get a deeper understanding.

### While building a little bookkeeping app we'll cover:

- Configuring Routes
- Navigating with Link
- Creating Links with active styling
- Using Nested Routes for Layout
- Navigating programmatically
- Using URL params for data loading
- Using URL Search params
- Creating your own behaviors through composition
